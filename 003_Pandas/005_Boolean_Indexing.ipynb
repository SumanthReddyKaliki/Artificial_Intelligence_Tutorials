    "Filtering data from a dataset is one of the most common and basic operations. There are numerous ways to filter (or subset) data in pandas with boolean indexing. Boolean indexing (also known as boolean selection) can be a confusing term, but for the purposes of pandas, it refers to selecting rows by providing a boolean value (True or False) for each row. These boolean values are usually stored in a Series or NumPy ndarray and are usually created by applying a boolean condition to one or more columns in a DataFrame. We begin by creating boolean Series and calculating statistics on them and then move on to creating more complex conditionals before using boolean indexing in a wide variety of ways to filter data.\n",

SQL is a standardized language to define, manipulate, and control data stored in a database. The SELECT statement is the most common way to use SQL to select, filter, aggregate, and order data. Pandas has the ability to connect to databases and send SQL statements to them.\n",

    "SQL is a very important language to know for data scientists. Much of the world's data is stored in databases that necessitate SQL to retrieve, manipulate, and perform analyses on. SQL syntax is fairly simple and easy to learn. There are many different SQL implementations from companies such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and more. Although the syntax is not compatible between the different implementations, the core of it will look very much the same.\n",

    "Histograms are fantastic plots to summarize and visualize one-dimensional numeric data. It is clear from the plot that the distribution is symmetrical but it remains difficult to determine whether it is normal or not.
